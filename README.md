# MathArrayRandom
exercises using Math., Arrays and Random()


1. Write a program that receives a number from the user and calculates its square root using the Math.sqrt( ) method.

2. Implement a code that calculates the value of a base raised to an exponent (both provided by the user) using the Math.pow( ) method.

3. Create a program that receives the values ​​of the legs of a right triangle
and calculates the hypotenuse using the Math.hypot( ) method.

4. Write a program that converts an angle from degrees to radians and calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent using the Math.sin( ), Math.cos( ), and Math.tan( ) methods.

5. Implement a code that simulates rolling a die (6 sides) 100 times and counts the number of occurrences of each side.

6. Write a program that generates a random 10-character password,
combining uppercase, lowercase letters, and numbers.

7. Implement a game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess. The program should provide hints ("higher" or "lower") until the user guesses correctly.

8. Create a program that simulates flipping a coin 50 times and counts how many times it came up heads and how many times it came up tails.

9. Write code that uses the ‘SecureRandom’ class to generate a sequence
of 10 random integers and display them.

10. Write a program that takes two names as input and concatenates them into a single string, displaying the result.

11. Create a program that compares two strings provided by the user and determines whether they are equal or different, ignoring differences in upper and lower case.

12. Write a code that receives a sentence from the user and extracts a substring based on the given indexes (starting and ending).

13. Implement a program that counts the number of words in a sentence
provided by the user. Consider that the words are separated by spaces.

14. Write a program that reverses the order of the characters in a string
provided by the user.

15. Create a program that checks whether a word or phrase is a palindrome (it reads the same way backwards, ignoring spaces and punctuation).

16. Implement a code that replaces all occurrences of a specific word in a sentence with another word, both provided by the user.

17. Write a program that splits a sentence into words based on a
delimiter (e.g. comma) and displays each word on a new line.

18. Implement code that removes leading and trailing whitespace from a user-supplied string and displays the result.
